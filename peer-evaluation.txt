I learned how I would end the game.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

As above how I would go at ending the game.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

There is not much room for improvement in terms of improving their code. It is clean and neat. 

What could have been clearer or better commented?

I would maybe have given instructions on how to play.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

There was nothing about the code that was confusing or unclear.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

Yes it does. It contains the year and their name.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

Again they could have added instructions.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

Their code is neat and well made. There wasnt much room for error in this project anyway.
